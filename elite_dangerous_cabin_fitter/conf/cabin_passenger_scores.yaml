# Defines how well a given passenger group fits a given cabin quality
# Read these as, given I have quality X, how would Y score
# e.g.:
#   - a business cabin perfectly fits a passenger group requiring a business cabin, so perfect score of 1
#   - a luxury cabin is a VERY poor fit for an economy passenger group, so that scores 0.125
#   - a first-class passenger group CANNOT be put into an economy or business class cabin, so both score 0
